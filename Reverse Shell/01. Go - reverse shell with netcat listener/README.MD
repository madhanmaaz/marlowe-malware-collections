# Reverse shell with netcat listener
![post](./image.png)

- Description
A reverse shell is a type of shell session that is initiated from a remote machine, typically a target machine, back to the attacker's machine. This allows the attacker to gain control of the target machine through the command line interface.Here's how it typically works:

    1. Attacker's Setup: The attacker sets up a machine to listen for incoming connections on a specific port. This machine will act as a server.

    2. Target Machine Execution: The target machine, either through user interaction (like opening a malicious file) or a vulnerability exploit, executes a piece of code that creates an outbound connection to the attacker's listening machine.

    3. Connection Established: Once the connection is established, the attacker can execute commands on the target machine as if they were physically present at the command prompt.
